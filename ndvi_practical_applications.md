# üåø NDVI Analysis Project Worksheet  

This worksheet will guide you through the process of designing and carrying out an NDVI-based analysis in R. Fill in the prompts for your chosen research question, location, time period, data sources, and methods.  

---Lehiwa W-F and Maka ªala

## 1. Framing the Question  

**What environmental or social issue will you explore?**  
Invasive plant species in Lehua forest, ROD.
CRB hotspots in Hawai ªi.
Native or non-native vegetation.

---

**Why is NDVI an appropriate tool for this question?**  
NDVI can be used to track the spread of invasive plants over time by monitoring changes in the vegetation index. As  ª≈çhi ªa trees sicken and die from ROD, their leaf greenness (chlorophyll contnet) decreases, and canopy health declines. This change is detectable by NDVI, which would slow a corresponding decrease in the vegetation.

**Who might find your results meaningful or useful?**  
Department Forestry and Wildlife
Daprtment of Natural Land Resource Management 
State legistration for policy and money efforts
Local communities and non-profit

## 2. Choosing a Place and Time  

**What geographic area will you focus on?**  
The Hawaiian Islands.  
Before ROD 2000 - 2008 - Present 2025

---

**What time frame makes sense for your question?**  
Multiple years 

---

**How will you define the scope of your analysis?**  
Focus on using time-series satellite data to track and interpret vegetation health changes, and to distinguish ROD-induced mortality from other environmental factors. Differentiate from other disturbances: isolate the NDVI signature of ROD-related mortality from other causes of vegetation stress, such as drought, fire, deforestation and other invasive species.

## 3. Finding Data  

**Where could you get satellite imagery or NDVI data?**  
(https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/rapid-ohia-death-rod/)
https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/
NOAA website

---

**What resolution and frequency are appropriate?**  
Remote sensing of Rapid  ª≈åhi ªa death (ROD) in Hawai ªi.
High frequency monitoring.
Identify individual dying trees.
High spatial resolution.
Track disease ªs spead over time.
High frequency of data collection.

---

**Will you download data manually or use an R package? Which one?**  
Using R Package. 

---

## 4. Bringing Data into R  

**What R packages can help you work with spatial data?**  
Forest boundries
Plot locations
Spatial raster data (Satelite imagery)
Time series analysis
Visualization
terra, sf, RStoolbix, gglpot2, tidyterra, MODIStsp.

---

**How will you handle projections, boundaries, or missing data?**  
  

---

**What file formats will you be working with?**  
GeoTIFF(.tif)
NetCDF(.nc)
Zippedfiles
Jp2
Shape file

---

## 5. Calculating NDVI  

**What is the NDVI formula?**  
NDVI = (NIR - Red)/(NIR + Red)

---

**Which spectral bands are needed?**  
For sentinal near infer red Band 4 and 8.
4 and 5 landsat

---

**How will you apply this formula in R?**  
Install and import data
Visualize using terra and ggplot2

---

## 6. Exploring and Visualizing Data  

**How will you summarize NDVI values?**  
Combination of maps, plots, and tables to show the spatial patterns, termporal trends, and statistical distrubtion of vegetation health. This approach helps track the disease ªs progression, pinpoint affected areas, and identify long-term changes in forest health. 
hotspot time series, color gradient for NDVI health. 

---

**Will you compare locations, beofre and after events, look at seasonal patterns, or study long-term trends?**  
Before ad after events

---

**How will you make your visualizations clear and interpretable?**  
Spacial and temporal analysis
time series report

---

## 7. Interpreting Results  

**What patterns or relationships do you expect to see?**  
ROD and NDVI: Expect a negative correlation, ROD leads to lower NDVI values, signlaing the browning and death of native  ª≈çhi ªa trees.
